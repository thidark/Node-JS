This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
    It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

    See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

    Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

    Press ^C at any time to quit.
